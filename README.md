# Machine Learning & AI

This repository contains my practice and projects for Machine Learning and basic AI concepts.

## 📘 What I'm Learning
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
- Train/Test split
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Mini ML Projects

## 🎯 Goal
Build a strong foundation in ML algorithms and apply them to real-world datasets after completing Data Science basics.

## 📅 Updates
I will upload my ML practice notebooks and projects when I reach this stage in my learning roadmap.
